You multiply Pi multiplied by the radius squared to find the area and multiply area by height to find the volume. That means the volume of a pizza that has a nominal radius of (z) and height (a) will, of course, be: Pi × z × z × a

And strangely, if you enter Pi to two decimal places (3.14) in the your calculator and look at it in the mirror, you'll see it spells 'pie'.
