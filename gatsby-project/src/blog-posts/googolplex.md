The universe isn't big enough for Googolplex.

A googolplex is 10 to the power of a googol, or 10 to the power of 10 to the power of 100. Our known universe doesn't have enough space to actually write that out on paper. If you try to do that sum on a computer, you'll never get the answer, because it won't have enough memory.
