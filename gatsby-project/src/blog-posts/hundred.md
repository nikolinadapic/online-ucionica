1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 make 100.

... but not with those comma placements. There are at least three different ways to use the numbers 1-9 in that order without multiplying or dividing in order to reach 100:

Route 1:
123 + 4 - 5 + 67 - 89 = 100.

Route 2:
123 - 4 - 5 - 6 - 7 + 8 - 9 = 100.

Route 3:
1 + 23 - 4 + 5 + 6 + 78 - 9 = 100.

Bet you can find Route 4...
