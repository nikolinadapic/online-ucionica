Weirdly, random numbers aren't actually all that random. In a given list of numbers representing anything from populations to building heights to border lengths, fully one third of them will begin with the digit 1. Fewer will begin with 2 and so on until only one number in twenty begins with a 9. The bigger the data set, and the more orders of magnitude it spans, the more strongly this pattern emerges.
